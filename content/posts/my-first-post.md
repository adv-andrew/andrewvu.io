# My Deep Dive into Computer Using Agents: Testing Microsoft UFO2 and the Future of AI Automation

As a software developer passionate about AI innovation, I recently spent a weekend exploring the fascinating world of **Computer Using Agents (CUA)** - AI systems that can interact with computer interfaces just like humans do. What started as curiosity turned into a comprehensive analysis of where we are today and where this technology is heading.

## The Spark: Jeffrey Zang's Opus Project

It all began when my friend **Jeffrey Zang** demoed his hackathon project from Waterloo University called **"Opus"** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/jeffrey-zang/opus)). The demonstration was genuinely mind-blowing and sparked my curiosity about the current state of AI automation.

### Understanding Microsoft's Opus Architecture

Microsoft's Opus represents a significant advancement in multimodal AI systems. The architecture leverages:

- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** for screen understanding
- **Action planning modules** that break down complex tasks
- **Execution engines** that translate plans into UI interactions
- **Feedback loops** for error correction and adaptation

The key innovation is Opus's ability to understand visual contexts and translate natural language instructions into precise computer actions.

## Hands-On with Microsoft UFO2: A Reality Check

Inspired by Jeffrey's demo, I dove into Microsoft's latest research: **UFO2** ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/UFO)). This April 2025 release represents the cutting edge of Computer Using Agents technology.

### The Test: A Simple but Revealing Task

I decided to test UFO2 with what seemed like a straightforward request:

> "Open File Explorer, navigate to the Documents folder, right-click in an empty space, create a new text file named 'todo.txt', and open it in Notepad"

### The Results: Eye-Opening Performance Metrics

- **Cost**: $1.12 using GPT-4o Turbo API
- **Time**: 8 minutes
- **Success Rate**: Multiple failed attempts due to circular loops

The system struggled with:
- Navigation errors (wrong folders)
- Action repetition loops
- Excessive backtracking
- Inefficient decision-making

### Microsoft UFO Architecture Deep Dive

UFO2's architecture is inherently **token-heavy**, which explains the performance issues:

1. **Screen Capture & Analysis**: Each screenshot requires extensive vision model processing
2. **Action Planning**: Complex reasoning chains for seemingly simple tasks
3. **Error Recovery**: Multiple API calls for course correction
4. **Context Maintenance**: Large token windows to maintain task state

This token-intensive approach leads to both cost and latency challenges in real-world applications.

## Current State Analysis: The Automation Paradox

### Where We Stand Today

The current CUA landscape is characterized by:

- **High Costs**: Simple tasks requiring significant API spend
- **Slow Execution**: Minutes for tasks humans complete in seconds
- **Reliability Issues**: Frequent failures requiring human intervention
- **Limited Scalability**: Token costs make broad deployment impractical

### The OpenAI Factor

While I haven't yet tested **OpenAI's CUA/Operator** system, early reports suggest more optimized performance. OpenAI's advantage likely stems from:
- Tighter integration between reasoning and action models
- More efficient token usage strategies
- Better training on computer interaction tasks

## Vision for the Future: The OS-Level AI Assistant

### My Concept: Overlay Chat Agent

I envision the ultimate CUA as an **OS-level overlay chat system** that serves as your personal automation agent. Imagine asking:

- *"Locate my project files and attach them to this email"*
- *"Install this Minecraft mod"* (automatically installing Forge, downloading the mod, and placing it in `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods/`)
- *"Schedule a meeting with the team for next Tuesday"*

### Key Requirements for Practical CUA

1. **Sub-minute execution** for common tasks
2. **Cost-effective operation** (not requiring a "sandwich budget" for 5 prompts)
3. **High reliability** with minimal human intervention
4. **Context awareness** across applications and workflows

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Optimization Strategies

To achieve practical CUA systems, we need:

- **Lightweight action models** specialized for UI interaction
- **Efficient state representation** reducing token overhead
- **Predictive caching** for common action sequences
- **Local processing** for privacy-sensitive operations

### Industry Implications

For **software engineers** and **machine learning engineers**, this space represents massive opportunities:
- Building more efficient CUA architectures
- Developing specialized training datasets
- Creating domain-specific automation tools
- Optimizing model inference for real-time interaction

## Conclusion: The Road Ahead

Computer Using Agents represent a transformative technology that's still in its early stages. While current implementations like UFO2 demonstrate impressive capabilities, they also highlight the significant engineering challenges ahead.

As someone deeply interested in **AI automation** and **software development**, I see immense potential for optimization and innovation in this space. The race is on to build the first truly practical, cost-effective CUA system.

For recruiters and fellow developers: this is a space worth watching closely. The team that cracks efficient CUA will revolutionize how we interact with computers.
